  <h2><a href="/2009/01/25/seven-things.html">Seven Things</a></h2>

  
<p>Damn you, <a href="http://flinglog.com">Brian!</a> for tagging me with this meme. But, since it is currently snowing (again?!?!) here in the Seattle area, I figured I needed a diversion. So here goes&#8230;</p>
<h2>One</h2>
<p>I was born left-handed. My parents are from the West Indies and apparently, being left-handed was considered <span class="caps">BAD</span>. So, at a very young age whenever my Mom saw me doing something with my left hand, she would say &#8220;Use your right hand!&#8221;. My wife told me she thought I was left-handed when she met me because I tended to do things with that hand. Ironically, both my son and our new President are left-handed. I&#8217;ve also learned that lefties tend to be more creative and possibly smarter. See what you&#8217;ve done to me, Mom?</p>
<h2>Two</h2>
<p>I met my wife on a blind date. I was at a party where I met up with some mutual friends. After hours of drinking and talking, one of the girls remarked, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you don&#8217;t have a girlfriend. You have to meet our friend, Donna.&#8221; Oh great. Since she wasn&#8217;t there and all the girls that were were&#8230;hot, then this must be the ugly one. :-) A few weeks pass by and a friend of mine calls me up one night, saying &#8220;Hey, remember that girl that those girls wanted you to meet?&#8221; Me: &#8220;Yeah&#8230;?&#8221; Friend: &#8220;Here she is.&#8221; (click)</p>
<p>One tentative conversation led to a first date. It could have been disastrous since I was late driving out to the boondocks of Long Island after spending the day helping a friend move. She was annoyed and I was tired. However, a good Italian meal and a bad movie made things better. A couple of more dates led to a vacation in Jamaica and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<h2>Three</h2>
<p>I used to be very good at math. I was an honors student all through grade school and most of high school. My math skills declined (and my social skills improved) by the time I hit college and took my first calculus course. I suspect the cause of the change may have been either:</p>
<ul>
	<li>My mostly Japanese-speaking professor</li>
	<li>My complete disinterest in anything other than my Computer Science courses</li>
	<li>Girls</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, my math skills seem to be stuck at intermediate algebra.</p>
<h2>Four</h2>
<p>I love comic books and comic book movies. While I no longer collect them, I do have a pretty big collection in my garage. Batman and Iron Man are my all-time favorites. Superman is a punk (he turned down Wonder Woman&#8217;s advances in one issue!! What?!?!) So, when the live action Iron Man movie came out in 2008 as well as Dark Knight, I could have died happy and complete.</p>
<h2>Five</h2>
<p>I am technology agnostic. I&#8217;ve tried lots of different computing platforms. The first computer I ever used was an Apple II and the first one I owned was an Apple IIc. I&#8217;ve had and developed for PCs running <span class="caps">DOS</span>, Windows (3.1 &#8211; XP, including NT and 2000). I have worked on numerous workstations running SunOS, <span class="caps">AIX</span>, HP/UX and Irix. I tried owning a Linux workstation running Red Hat, but it frustrated me no end as a desktop. I might try again soon, as Ubuntu looks promising. Now, I am primarily a Mac user as it hits all the right notes for me.</p>
<p>Note to all Microsoft-bashers: Stop it! It&#8217;s not necessary. And the people that work there are not all bad; in fact, they&#8217;re mostly good people trying to do the right thing in a large corporation. If you don&#8217;t like Microsoft&#8217;s products or behavior, just vote with your dollars! That&#8217;s what really sends the message.</p>
<h2>Six</h2>
<p>My perfect vacation involves a week on an island (generally in the Caribbean) at some sort of all-inclusive resort. My days should consist of deciding whether to swim in the pool or the ocean first, enjoying great meals and getting to catch up on a ton of reading. One day can be allocated to some sort of touristy activity. But, just <span class="caps">ONE</span> day.</p>
<h2>Seven</h2>
<p>It is better to work for me than with me. At least, that&#8217;s what my co-workers say. I fiercely protect my team so that they can focus on doing great things. And, I have trouble managing up but I am trying to get better at that. However, at the end of the day I am an engineer and logic rules my world. My measure of success is building (or helping people build) great products.</p>
