<p class="byline">Posted by <strong>kstewart</strong> on 21 Feb 2012</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> The question isn&rsquo;t <em>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t there more blacks (or other non-Indian/Asian minorities) in tech?&rdquo;</em> The question is <em>&ldquo;Why are we still asking the wrong question?&rdquo;</em></p>

<h1>Black In America 4: The New Promised Land &ndash; Silicon Valley</h1>

<p>Let me start off by saving that I loved the CNN special, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/technology/newme_incubator/">Black In America 4: The New Promised Land &ndash; Silicon Valley</a>. A while back I had a short email exchange with <a href="http://whydoeseverythingsuck.com">Hank Williams</a> and connected with him on LinkedIn. When I saw that he was one of the founders that would be part of the <a href="http://www.newmeaccelerator.com/">NewMe Accelerator</a> program, I set a reminder to watch the show. I watched with great interest and it&rsquo;s still on my DVR as I&rsquo;ve watched it several times now. It was a great program and should be required watching for anyone in technology, no matter your race.</p>

<p>That said, something was nagging me about all of the companies that were being profiled. With one or two exceptions, I found myself asking the same question:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Why do you need venture capital?</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This is an important question that kept surfacing as I followed the debates that followed.</p>

<h1>Arrington&rsquo;s Not A Racist&hellip;He&rsquo;s Just Dishonest</h1>

<p>Black in America triggered a lot of debate in the tech community. The ever-volatile Michael Arrington started a bit of a controversy with his comments on the special and subsequent blog posts. Hank responded quite eloquently with <a href="http://whydoeseverythingsuck.com/2011/11/arringtons-not-racist-whos-said-that.html">a post</a> that inspired this section header. I think it accurately reflects a very large part of the problem. Hank says,</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So to conclude, no one is accusing Arrington of being a racist. But it&rsquo;s clear he is (or at least his writing reflects him to be) incredibly insensitive to issues of race and privilege.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>You see, there&rsquo;s racism and then there&rsquo;s <strong>RACISM</strong>. A lot of what people are quick to call racism is usually attributable to ignorance and/or insensitivity. Believe me, I know the difference as I&rsquo;ve experienced both. However, I think that people often mistake the former for the latter. True racism stems from hatred and fear and I&rsquo;ve found that a lot of people who are labeled racists do not exhibit the qualities of hatemongers. They are merely ignorant.</p>

<p>Let me tell you a bit about my background. First, if it isn&rsquo;t obvious (or, you couldn&rsquo;t bother to look at my avatar on Twitter or LinkedIn or half a dozen other places) I am a Black man.</p>

<blockquote><p>Quick note: I never refer to myself as an &ldquo;African-American&rdquo;.  Personally, I think it&rsquo;s a funny term as we ALL originally come from Africa, so how is this descriptive? It would be more accurate to call myself a &ldquo;West Indian-American&rdquo; since my parents are from Trinidad and Tobago, but even that&rsquo;s wrong. I was born in Brooklyn, NY so I&rsquo;m just an American.  And, I&rsquo;m Black. Plus, for those of you who don&rsquo;t know this already but REAL Africans actually dislike African-Americans. So, why would I self-identify with a group of people that wouldn&rsquo;t accept me in the first place? But I digress.</p></blockquote>

<p>My mom was a registered nurse and my dad was in construction management and trained as an architect. They both worked their asses off to ensure that I got a good education. I went to a Catholic grade school and junior high in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn, which was mostly an Italian neighborhood. Growing up, I was mostly surrounded by white kids. Our class size was fairly large, usually around 45 kids with a maximum of 6 of them being Black. And yes, my first encounters with racism occurred on the playground. Mom got called to the principal&rsquo;s office almost once a week from the first grade through sixth until she finally said, &ldquo;Stop calling me in here from work every week. I have a hard time thinking that my child is the only culprit in all this bad behavior.&rdquo; Amazingly, I stopped getting sent to the principal&rsquo;s office after that. By the time I graduated, I was an honors student and voted <strong>Most Likely To Succeed</strong>.</p>

<p>I attended Brooklyn Technical High School, one of the three specialized high schools in NYC. When it came time to apply to colleges, I applied to a lot of great schools and got accepted. Carnegie Mellon, Columbia, Rochester Institute of Technology, Penn State, CalTech&hellip;the list goes on. And, I pretty much got accepted to them all. However, I ended up passing on a lot of these schools because they made it clear that the reason I got accepted was the fact that I was Black. I was part of an <em>under-represented minority</em>. Yes, a couple of the acceptance letters actually said that!</p>

<p>I ended up at Polytechnic University (now part of NYU) in Brooklyn. Ironically, one of my high school pre-calculus teachers told my parents that I would never get accepted there and he would know as he was a professor there. So, on my first day of college was particularly sweet when I bumped into him in Rogers Hall. I walked up, tapped him on the shoulder, said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here&rdquo; and walked away.</p>

<p>I did OK in college, but I was no genius. I aced most of my Computer Science classes (except the hardware ones) and skated by on everything else. I mostly wanted to code and socialize. Eventually, I ended up working in a research lab and switched to part-time status so that the job would pay for most of my classes (I had a partial scholarship, but I still wanted to reduce the burden on my parents and lessen the debt I would have after graduation).</p>

<p>After graduation, I continued working in the research lab until the start of the dotcom boom. From interactive agencies to startups, I moved from being a technical lead to Director of Engineering. After a combination of being laid off and a personal tragedy, fate had me respond to a job posting for Adobe. My wife and I sold our home in NY and moved across the country to Seattle. Today, I&rsquo;m a Sr. Engineering Manager at Adobe working on a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html">pretty cool project</a>.</p>

<h1>Am I My Brother&rsquo;s Keeper?</h1>

<p>(<em>If you don&rsquo;t instantly recognize this pop culture, not biblical, reference then stop reading this post now and go watch <strong>New Jack City</strong>. Seriously.</em>)</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t write all of the above just to give you a mini-biography. I&rsquo;m just setting context. You see, while I have experienced more than my share of racism in my life I faced very little of it in my professional career. I&rsquo;ve never been passed over for a promotion. In fact I was promoted, given raises and stock and moved into management (and I still code when I can). I&rsquo;ve been a hiring manager for over 15 years now and managed engineers of many races, both men and women. In total, I&rsquo;ve probably had about 100 people reporting to me throughout my career. Of that group, fewer than 10 were Black.</p>

<p>Now, ask yourself why is that? Is it because I did not seek Black engineers out? Maybe. I didn&rsquo;t explicitly say, <em>&ldquo;Find me some brothers and sistas&rdquo;</em> to my recruiters. I didn&rsquo;t camp out at Howard University. Why? Because color was never an issue. Talent was. I rarely lacked a large pool of potential hires at any of the companies I worked for in the past. The problem was that there were very few (if any) black people in the pool.</p>

<p>More importantly, I ask myself whether I should have been working harder to recruit and hire Black developers? I am pretty convinced that the answer is <em>No</em>. I know some might say that I need to &ldquo;give back to the community&rdquo;, but which community would that be? The Black community? My neighborhood? The tech community? The professional community?</p>

<p>Not all Blacks have the same experiences, so the stereotypical expectations don&rsquo;t always apply. When I&rsquo;ve attended meetings or conferences for Black professionals, they always seemed to rub me the wrong way. They seemed to mostly perpetuate the <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re being held down&rdquo;</em> mentality of people who are still looking for reparations for slavery. While I am well aware of the social injustices that we&rsquo;ve faced as a people, they are not a part of my <strong>identity</strong>.</p>

<p>This is just my opinion, but I think there may be a hint of truth in it. I think there is still a lingering bitterness and distrust of white people that is preventing Black people from achieving their goals. If you think you&rsquo;re being held down by <strong>The Man</strong>, then you are. It&rsquo;s just that <em>&ldquo;The Man&rdquo;</em> is <strong>you</strong>.</p>

<h1>You Can Hate Me Now</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that there is a percentage of people that will call me a sellout, an Uncle Tom or some other derogatory term. Whatever. That would essentially be the same level of ignorance I referred to earlier with respect to white people that some think are racist. It&rsquo;s ignorance, not racism.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;d like is for us to address the real issues. I don&rsquo;t think that my story is all that unique, nor should it be. Let&rsquo;s look at what I think are the defining characteristics:</p>

<ol>
<li>Loving, caring parents at home</li>
<li>Education always deemed important</li>
<li>Letting the work speak for itself</li>
</ol>


<p>Ask yourself honestly, if more minority kids had these attributes growing up would they be better set up for success? If their parents focused on instilling these attributes I think that they would be doing them the biggest favor of all. Let&rsquo;s stop living in the past. I don&rsquo;t mean that we should forget history, but we should stop using history <em>as an excuse</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>No, I&rsquo;m not a damn Republican.</p></blockquote>

<h1>Wrapping Up</h1>

<p>At the beginning of this post, I said I wondered why so many of the NewMe founders were seeking venture capital. For what they were building, why not bootstrap? That would eliminate a lot of the VC &ldquo;pattern matching&rdquo;. Figure out how to charge money for your product or service and work your way up to a profitable business. Isn&rsquo;t getting rejected by Sequoia or Kleiner Perkins another version of <em>&ldquo;being held down by The Man&rdquo;</em>?</p>

<blockquote><p>I was watching NBC&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nbc.com/the-voice/">The Voice</a> while starting to write this. I think we need something like this for funding. Let&rsquo;s come up with a way to pitch investors &ldquo;blindly&rdquo;. Maybe if investors can&rsquo;t pattern match and have to judge a startup purely on the idea and proposed business model this might increase the odds of getting more minority-led companies funded. Just a thought&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not chugging haterade. I wish Angela and Wayne nothing but the best with the NewMe Accelerator Program. I may even apply one day. I just grow weary of the constant Racism (or Sexism) in Tech memes. Let&rsquo;s change the nature of the discourse. Talk to me about improving people&rsquo;s notions of parenting and education. Bend my ear about self-sufficiency and independence. Tell me how I can help you start a business that will be long-lived and prosperous, as opposed to trying to win the venture capital lottery.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll get my undivided attention.</p>
