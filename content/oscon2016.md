You are (or want to be) a manager at a tech company. Ideas you present are ignored while the same ideas, when presented by others, are accepted. You deliver on difficult projects time and again, yet deserved promotions and recognition seem to elude you. You build strong teams of talented individuals that other teams want for themselves. Still, you can’t get a seat at the decision makers’ table. Congratulations! You’re managing while black.

In this talk, I explore the challenges faced by people of color in leadership positions and explains why we might want to rethink how we approach diversity in the tech industry.
