title: Ruby at Adobe
---

Several years ago, I started a skunkworks project at Adobe. With the freedom to choose, I asked the team if we could try Ruby. Since they were all burnt out on C/C++ and had absolutely **no interest** in writing Java they jumped in. The skunkworks project failed, but the code morphed into what is now the [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://creative.adobe.com).

Along the way, we learned of others at Adobe using Ruby. The team that built [Photoshop.com](http://www.photoshop.com/) built that backend and the amazing synchronization service for [Adobe Revel](http://www.adoberevel.com/) in Ruby. With our acquisition of [Typekit](http://typekit.com), we added another talented team of Ruby talent to the Adobe family.

Interest and usage of Ruby is growing at an amazing rate here at Adobe as more and more teams see what they can do with such a versatile and proven language. They see the passion from the engineers who use Ruby, what they are able to create and how quickly things get done. It's addictive. But, you knew that already!

Both my team and the Typekit team have openings for API engineers. If you love Ruby, OS X and Linux and...OK, I won't ask which text editor you prefer. Use whatever you like (TextMate, Sublime Text, vim, emacs) then you should consider joining us. Yuou can apply using one of the links below or contact me via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/kstewart) or email me at kstewart at my company dot com.
